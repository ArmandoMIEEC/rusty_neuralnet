Implementation of a 2 layer feedforward neural network using a self made library crate in Rust for the Fuzzy Sets and Neural Networks Semester Project

In this project I developed a library in Rust for creating simple feedforward neural networks. I've also implemented a 2 layer neural network using the "neuralnet" library that I created.
